      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Deb Warrick and I work as a software developer at the University of Richmond.  I am taking this class to improve my understanding of the components of web development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Western Massachusettes, but it's cold up there so I moved south as soon as I could!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to hike in the woods, especially mountains.  I like to travel to new places both near and abroad. I like to read mysteries and watch Jeopardy.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to be a philanthropist/do-gooder.  This would require I be indepentently wealthy, so perhaps I would  need to be a lottery winner first. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Henrico County Virginia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because web developers rule the social media world!</p>
